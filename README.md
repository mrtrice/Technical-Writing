# Technical-Writing

My name is Anthony Ezubelu. I created this to document my future and present skills in Technical Writing. I started learning technical writing a few days back from MR. Wisdom and I'm about to submit my very first assignment. so I decided to make up this as a repository to update my progress and even in future jobs. I will always make more branches to this, to differentiate my class assignment and other jobs.

I don't mind collaborating with anyone that wishes to do the same with me. I'm always open to learning and learning new things in life.

Thank you.
